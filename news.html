				<p>Earlier this week, NASA hosted the “Planetary Science Vision 2050 Workshop” at their<br> 
				headquarters in Washington, DC. Running from Monday to Wednesday – February 27th to <br>
				March 1st – the purpose of this workshop was to present NASA’s plans for the future of <br>
				space exploration to the international community. In the course of the many presentations,<br> 
				speeches and panel discussions, many interesting proposals were shared.</p>
				<p>Among them were two presentations that outlined NASA’s plan for the exploration of Jupiter’s<br>
				moon Europa and other icy moons. In the coming decades, NASA hopes to send probes to these moons to<br>
				investigate the oceans that lie beneath theirs surfaces, which many believe could be home to extra-terrestrial<br>
				life. With missions to the “ocean worlds” of the Solar System, we may finally come to discover life beyond Earth.<br>
				<p>The first of the two meetings took place on the morning of Monday, Feb. 27th, and was titled “Exploration Pathways<br>
				for Europa after initial In-Situ Analyses for Biosignatures“. In the course of the presentation, Kevin Peter Hand – the<br>
				Deputy Chief Scientist for Solar System Exploration at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory – shared findings from a report <br>
				prepared by the 2016 Europa Lander Science Definition Team.</p>

			<h3>THIS ASTEROID BROKE IN HALF, AND THEN BOTH HALVES GREW TAILS LIKE COMETS</h3>
				Published: 3 Mar , 2017<br>

				<img src="img/div2.jpg"><br>
				<p>In the 18th and 19th centuries, astronomers made some profound discoveries about asteroids and comets within our<br>
				Solar System. From discerning the true nature of their orbits to detecting countless small objects in the Main Asteroid<br>
				Belt, these discoveries would inform much of our modern understanding of these bodies.</p>
				<p>A general rule about comets and asteroids is that whereas the former develop comas or tails as they undergo temperature<br>
				changes, the latter do not. However, a recent discovery by an international group of researchers has presented another exception<br>
				to this rule. After viewing a parent asteroid in the Main Belt that split into a pair, they noted that both fragments formed tails of their own.</p>
				<p>The reason asteroids do not do behave like comets has a lot to do with where they are situated. Located predominantly in the Main Belt,<br>
				these bodies have relatively circular orbits around the Sun and do not experience much in the way of temperature changes. As a result, they<br>
				do notform tails (or halos), which are created when volatile compounds (i.e. nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, etc.) sublimate and<br>
				form clouds of gas.</p>

			<h3>CATCH ‘THE GREAT AMERICAN OCCULTATION’ OF ALDEBARAN SATURDAY NIGHT</h3>

				<p>Ever watch the Moon cover up a star? There’s a great chance to see just such an event this coming weekend, when the waxing gibbous<br>
				Moon occults (passes in front of)  the bright star Aldebaran for much of North America on Saturday night, March 4th.</p>
				<p>Shining at magnitude +0.85, Aldebaran is the brightest star that lies along the Moon’s path in the current epoch, and is one of four<br>
				+1st magnitude stars that the Moon can occult. The other three are Regulus, Antares and Spica. This is the 29th in a series of 49 occultations<br>
				of Aldebaran worldwide spanning from January 29th, 2015 to September 3rd, 2018, meaning Aldebaran hides behind the Moon once every lunation as it<br>crosses through the constellation Taurus and the Hyades open star cluster in 2017. Like eclipses belonging to the same saros cycle, successive<br>occultations of bright stars shift westward by about 120 degrees westward longitude and slowly drift to the north. Europe saw last month’s occultation of Aldebaran, and Asia is up next month on April 1st.</p>

			<h3>WHEN GALAXIES COLLIDE, STARS SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES</h3>
				Article Updated: 2 Mar , 2017<br>

				<img src="img/div4.jpg"><br>
				<p>When galaxies collide, the result is nothing short of spectacular. While this type of event only takes place once every few billion<br>
				years (and takes millions of years to complete), it is actually pretty common from a cosmological perspective. And interestingly enough,<br>
				one of the most impressive consequences – stars being ripped apart by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) – is quite common as well.</p>
				<p>This process is known in the scientific community as stellar cannibalism, or Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs). Until recently, astronomers<br>
				believed that these sorts of events were very rare. But according to a pioneering study conducted by leading scientists from the University of<br>
				Sheffield, it is actually 100 times more likely than astronomers previously suspected.</p>
				<p>TDEs were first proposed in 1975 as an inevitable consequence of black holes being present at the center of galaxies. When a star passes close<br>enough to be subject to the tidal forces of a SMBH it undergoes what is known as “spaghetification”, where material is slowly pulled away and<br>
				forms string-like shapes around the black hole. The process causes dramatic flare ups that can be billions of times brighter than all the stars in<br>the galaxy combined.</p>

			<h3>NASA PROPOSES A MAGNETIC SHIELD TO PROTECT MARS’ ATMOSPHERE</h3>
				Article Updated: 2 Mar , 2017<br>
				by Matt Williams<br>
				<img src="img/div5.jpg"><br>
				<p>This week, NASA’s Planetary Science Division (PSD) hosted a community workshop at their headquarters in Washington, DC. Known as the<br>
				“Planetary Science Vision 2050 Workshop“, this event ran from February 27th to March 1st, and saw scientists and researchers from all over<br>
				the world descend on the capitol to attend panel discussions, presentations, and talks about the future of space exploration.</p>
				<p>One of the more intriguing presentations took place on Wednesday, March 1st, where the exploration of Mars by human astronauts was discussed.<br>In the course of the talk, which was titled “A Future Mars Environment for Science and Exploration“, Director Jim Green discussed how deploying<br>a magnetic shield could enhance Mars’ atmosphere and facilitate crewed missions there in the future.</p>
				<p>The current scientific consensus is that, like Earth, Mars once had a magnetic field that protected its atmosphere. Roughly 4.2 billion years<br>ago, this planet’s magnetic field suddenly disappeared, which caused Mars’ atmosphere to slowly be lost to space. Over the course of the next 500<br>million years, Mars went from being a warmer, wetter environment to the cold, uninhabitable place we know today.</p>
				<p>This theory has been confirmed in recent years by orbiters like the ESA’s Mars Express and NASA’s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN<br>
				Mission (MAVEN), which have been studying the Martian atmosphere since 2004 and 2014, respectively. In addition to determining that solar wind<br>
				was responsible for depleting Mars’ atmosphere, these probes have also been measuring the rate at which it is still being lost today.</p>
				<p>Without this atmosphere, Mars will continue to be a cold, dry place where life cannot flourish. In addition to that, future crewed<br>
				mission – which NASA hopes to mount by the 2030s – will also have to deal with some severe hazards. Foremost among these will be exposure to<br>
				radiation and the danger of asphyxiation, which will pose an even greater danger to colonists (should any attempts at colonization be made).</p>
				<p>In answer to this challenge, Dr. Jim Green – the Director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division – and a panel of researchers presented an<br>
				ambitious idea. In essence, they suggested that by positioning a magnetic dipole shield at the Mars L1 Lagrange Point, an artificial<br>
				magnetosphere could be formed that would encompass the entire planet, thus shielding it from solar wind and radiation.</p>
				<p>Naturally, Green and his colleagues acknowledged that the idea might sounds a bit “fanciful”.</p>
